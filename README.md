NOTE:
-
tools:
</br>1.The python code is based on the python data science platform Anaconda2.
</br>2.The python code is tested on Windows by PyCharm.


data:
</br>3.The features of convolutional layer(Pool5 layer) of VGG16 for Oxford5k and Paris6k datasets are in path "data\feature". 
</br>4.The order of part detectors are in path "data\filter_select".
</br>5.The groundtruth for Oxford5k and Paris6k datasets are in path "data\gt_files".


code:
</br>6.Run evaluate.py, the mAP is printed.
</br>7.Run select_filter.py to get the order of part detectors according to variances.
